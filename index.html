             <p> More than 37,000 people were injured <br> from using cookware. Hot handles can <br> burn and sometimes glass cookware <br> can shatter.</p>

                 <p>
                    More than 10,000 people were hurt <br> using microwaves. Burns were most <br> common.

                 <h2>Knife cuts</h2>
                 <p>Lacerations caused by knives of all <br> kinds (not just the kitchen type) <br> affected more than 350,000 people in <br> 2012, according to the Consumer <br> Product Safety Commission. Dull   <br>  knives are actually more dangerous <br> than sharp ones, because they require <br> more pressure to use and their worn <br> edge can cause the knife to slip off <br> food and into your fingers.</p>

                 <h2>Cooking fires</h2>
                 <p>
                    Fires involving cooking equipment  <br>  account for two of every five reported <br> home fires. Unattended cooking <br> equipment accounts for one in three <br> fires, and half are ignited by fat,<br> grease, oil, or related substances,<br> according to the National Fire <br> Protection Association.

                 <h2>Contact Burns From <br> Equipment</h2>
                 <p>
                    The oven is magic. No longer do we <br> have to sear our food on an open fire <br> like our ancestors did; we have a nifty <br> box that keeps the heat contained and <br> cooks our food to perfection. But all <br> that heat combined with metal <br> components and cookware leads to <br> loads of burns. Quick tips (which are <br> obvious, but good to keep in mind): <br> Always use oven mitts, replace them <br> when they’re old; don’t use a wet   <br> towel as an oven mitt; don’t reach your <br> arm in to check baked goods, pull out <br> the rack to test;

                 <h2>   Death to the Pathogens</h2>
            <p>
             
                The most insidious of all dangers, <br> perhaps, are the germs lurking in your <br> food. The Centers for Disease Control <br> and Prevention (CDC) estimates that <br> each year roughly one in six <br> Americans (or 48 million people) gets <br> sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and <br> 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. The <br> top five culprits sending Americans to <br> the hospital are salmonella, norovirus,<br> Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma <br> gondii and E.coli – but much can be <br> done in terms of proper food handling, <br> cooking and storage to help prevent <br> these pathogens from causing illness.
